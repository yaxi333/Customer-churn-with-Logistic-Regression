    "*   All solutions to theoretical and pratical problems must be submitted in this ipynb notebook, and equations wherever required, should be formatted using LaTeX math-mode.\n",
    "*   All discussion regarding practical problems, along with solutions and plots should be specified in this notebook. All plots/results should be visible such that the notebook do not have to be run. But the code in the notebook should reproduce the plots/results if we choose to do so.\n",
    "*   Your name, personal number and email address should be specified above.\n",
    "*   All tables and other additional information should be included in this notebook.\n",
    "*   **All the answers for theoretical questions must be filled in the cells created for you with \"Your answer here\" below each question, but feel free to add more cells if needed.**\n",
    "*   Before submitting, make sure that your code can run on another computer. That all plots can show on another computer including all your writing. It is good to check if your code can run here: https://colab.research.google.com.\n"

    "### Customer churn with Logistic Regression\n",
    "A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you are an analyst at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.\n",
    "This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyse all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.\n",
    "The dataset includes information about:\n",
    "*   Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn.\n",
    "*   Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.\n",
    "*   Customer account information – how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.\n",
    "*   Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.\n",
    "We will help you load and visualise the dataset as well as the preprocessing, you need to build up your logistic regression model step by step and do the prediction.\n",
    "*   **Remember, you are not allowed to use sklearn in modelling and predicting, you have to fill your code in the skeleton.** \n",
